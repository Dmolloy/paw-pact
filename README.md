# Paw-Pact

## Overview 
The aim of the website is to promote a new dog rescue shelter opening in Galway city. The mission
is to provide safety and security to vunerable dogs that have been neglected, abandonded, abused, or 
surrendered. We want to care for these dogs, while also trying to find them new homes. Helping them by retraining, and rehabilitaion. The end goal is to give each dog thier new forever home, and see them thrive.

This was a solo project built using only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It focuses on clean UI, accessibility, and responsiveness for various screen sizes.

## User Experience Design

The site was designed with the idea of having a clean and clear user experience. The site needed to present the information clearly, and be responsive to users no matter what device they were using.

There are three pages, each with it's own purpose. This was to help keep things clear on each page and avoid any unnecessary clutter. There are links to each page on the navigation bar.

The footer contains a map and address to the shelter. There is also a contact from for getting in touch with the shelter. After completing the form, users are brought to a success page, to let them know the form was sucessfully submitted. With a link to return home. 

### Colour Scheme

The site uses colours that help give a feeling of calmness and warmth. https://colorkit.co/ was used to help find the right colours that would convey the right message. https://webaim.org/ was used to help compare the contrasts of the colours selected to ensure readability throughout the site.
